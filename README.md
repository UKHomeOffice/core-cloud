# Core Cloud

SAS Core Cloud aims to be a high quality, easy to operate, strategic platform for the Home Office.

## Principles 

Core Cloud follows 6 fundamental principles that we use to robustly evaluate the decisions we make.

### Available, reliable and testable

Core Cloud designs for automation, allowing frequent, small, reversible changes.\
Core Cloud considers blast radius reduction, disaster recovery, and automated failover and recovery as essential considerations in its design.\
Core Cloud allows applications to reliably operate at scale.\
Core Cloud has robust operational procedures.

### Inclusive and accessible 

Core Cloud practices an 'open by default' stance, this includes design documentation, decisions, and code repositories, and we welcome contributions.\
Core Cloud commits to publishing honest data about SLAs, availability metrics, and detailed RCAs.\
Core Cloud will clearly communicate upcoming changes, maintenance and upgrades.\
Core Cloud treats documentation as a 'first class citizen'.\
Core Cloud aims to make the onboarding of teams and engineers and ongoing use of the platform as simple as possible.

### Unobtrusive Security

Core Cloud respects the [NCSC cloud security principles](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud/the-cloud-security-principles).\
Core Cloud practices defense in depth and has clear separation between teams.

### Native first

Core Cloud is native first, favouring AWS native tooling and managed services over custom tooling.\
Core Cloud aims to be [well architected](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected).

### Responsible with cost

Core Cloud operates consumption-based billing meaning teams only pay for their usage.\
This incentivises teams to take responsibility and optimise resources attributed to them.\
Core Cloud supports teams in optimising their resources using techniques like autoscaling, downscaling, spot pricing and ARM powered instances.
