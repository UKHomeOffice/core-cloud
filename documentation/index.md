## Intended Audience

This guide is intended for existing or potential customers of Core Cloud who need information on how to deploy and operate their digital services.

## Core Cloud Philosophy

Core Cloud aims to be a high quality, easy to operate, strategic platform suitable for the majority of digital services built within the Home Office.



We will support customers to operate in a way that works for them while governing security, cost responsibility and resiliency to ensure that all customers and stakeholders are adequately considered and fairly represented.

We will provide a thin layer of governance for all customers of primarily 'platform' concerns such as account vending, boundary controls and guardrails. Customers are then free to provision their workloads within that governance. \
We encourage customers to take advantage of our shared capability product teams or self-service provisioning though our service catalogue. We also encourage customers to contribute shared capability to our service catalogue rather than deviate from it. \
For customers who require more engagement we provide 'service-desk' access to the same product teams and catalogue. \
Customers can pick different models for different resources. For example, you may want to provision and administer RDS yourself, but you may not want to provision and maintain your own EKS cluster. \
You may want to self-serve namespaces on our shared cluster or have us maintain a dedicated cluster on your behalf.

We believe in [open by default](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_by_default) and the vast majority of information about Core Cloud including technical designs and processes are maintained within this guide. 

We believe in [eating our own dog food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) and when supporting customers we follow the same documentation and process that customers would follow themselves. \
This ensures that documentation is maintained and any pain points are identified, understood and ideally, removed.
