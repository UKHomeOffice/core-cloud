**We operate consumption-based billing**. \
This means teams only pay for their usage and are incentivised to optimise their resources. 

**We support teams in optimising their resources** using techniques like autoscaling, downscaling, spot pricing and ARM powered instances.

**Sensible defaults** in our service catalogue mean teams can run cheaply by default and won't have to spend development effort reinventing the wheel.

**Shared capability** of common tooling reduces the cost and effort for each team.
