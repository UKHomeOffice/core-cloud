**We operate consumption-based billing**. \
Customers are charged on a consumption model and are incentivised to optimise their resources. 

**We support customers in optimising their resources.** \
Techniques like autoscaling, downscaling, spot pricing and ARM powered instances can lower costs and improve performance.

**Sensible defaults** in our service catalogue mean customers can run cheaply by default and won't have to spend development effort reinventing the wheel.

**Shared services** will be used to reduce the cost and effort for customers.
