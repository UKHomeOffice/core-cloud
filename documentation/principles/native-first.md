**Our approach is to be native first**. \
Where new requirements are identified, and no Home Office strategic solution exists, we will favour AWS native tooling and managed services over custom tooling and services.

**We will aim to be [well architected](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected)** to ensure we can maintain the capability to provide reliable, cost-effective, secure, and efficient cloud environments.
