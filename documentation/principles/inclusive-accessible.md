**We practice 'open by default'.** \
This includes design documentation, decisions, and code repositories.

**We welcome contributions.**

**We will publish honest data** about how we're meeting SLAs.

**We will provide detailed RCAs** and use them to learn from our mistakes.

**Communicating change to customers is crucial.** \
We will clearly communicate upcoming changes, maintenance and upgrades.

**Documentation is a 'first class citizen'** and will be easy to follow, to reduce failure demand.
